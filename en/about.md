NAVI BIO-THERAPEUTICS was founded in July 2013. NAVI develops clinical-level technique and equipment for ex vivo immune cell culture, and provides the service of clinical immunofunction analysis. Our goal is to develop personalized cell-based immunotherapy for the prevention and treatment of cancer, autoimmune, allergic and infectious disease.

NAVI’s research center is located in Asia New Bay Area of Kaohsiung city, and the laboratory meets the requirement of Good Tissue Practice (GTP). Our research is focused on the regulation and improvement of immune function through cell-based immunotherapy. The core technology includes multi-immune cell therapy, immunofunction analysis, closed cell-separation and culture system, and genetically engineered immune cells.  
NAVI, in cooperation with the institutes of clinical medicine and applied mechanics of National Taiwan University, develops clinical-level technique and equipment for ex vivo immune cell culture. Our mission is to use cell-based immunotherapy as an adjuvant treatment, combined with conventionally chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, in preventing cancer recurrence. NAVI expects to advance our therapeutic platform to the clinical trial at National Taiwan University Hospital in 2016.

## Core Technology {#core-tech}
- **Multi-Immune Cell Therapy (MICT)**: MICT is a kind of adoptive cell therapy that combines multi-types of immune cells, including dendritic cells, natural killer cells, and/or T cells.  
- **Immunofunction analysis**: lymphocyte subsets, cytokine profile, and cytotoxicity test.  
- **Closed culture system for the separation and expansion of immune cells**: Use of a closed culture system reduces the contamination risks during ex vivo cell culture.  
- **Genetically engineered immune cells**: Genetically modified immune cells improve the efficacy of cell-based immunotherapy.  
- **Gene therapy**: Application of siRNA in cancer treatment
