## Genetic Testing
**Genetic testing is a method for identifying persons who are in the early stages of, or at high risk for, the cancer of concern.**  

- **Mutation screening of cancer-related genes**:  
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is released from apoptotic or necrotic cells, and has short lifespan about 15min to several hours in the body. cfDNA can be extracted from blood plasma, and the mutation of cfDNA is detected by clonal differential amplifier PCR and Sanger sequencing methods. During clonal differential amplifier PCR cycles, the amplification of wild type gene is blocked by specific probe. Therefore, the amplification efficacy of mutant gene is increasing, which can enhance the sensitivity of mutant detection.

- **Methylation assay of cancer-related genes**:  
DNA methylation test can be used as a biomarker for early detection of cervical cancer and oral cancer. Customized methylation assays are also provided by NAVI.

## KIR Genotyping
**KIR typing provides the analysis of individual KIR profile for stem cell transplantation matching or basic research use.**  

Killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) are expressed on the cell surface of NK cells and a subset of T cells. Genes encoding KIRs belong to polymorphic gene families, and the major ligands for KIRs are MHC class I (HLA-A, B, C) molecules expressed on normal nucleated cells in the body. KIRs play important roles in the development, activation and tolerance of NK cells. The KIR typing allows the detection of the present or absent of 17 distinct human KIR genes and provides individual KIR profile for donors and recipients before haploidentical cell transplantation.

## Immune Cell Culture {#cell-culture}
**NAVI provide technical service of *ex vivo* culture of immune cells for clinical or
basic research use.**  

*Ex vivo* culture of immune cells:
- Natural killer cells
- Dendritic cells
- T cells
- Differentiation of immune cells from stem cells

## Immune Function Assay {#function-assay}
**Analysis of the immune system assist the subjects in early understanding the immune function of the body, and evaluating the probability of occurrence of infection or immune-related diseases.**

Evaluation of Immune function:  
- Cytokine profile  
- Cytotoxicity test  
- Dendritic subset analysis  
- Lymphocyte subset analysis  
- Phagocytosis test  
- Phenotyping and Functional analysis of lymphocyte subpopulations
